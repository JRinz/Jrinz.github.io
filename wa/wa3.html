<p><strong>Etymology</strong></p>

<p>"The name Amazon is said to arise from a war Francisco de Orellana fought with the Tapuyas and other tribes.
The women of the tribe fought alongside the men, as was their custom.
Orellana derived the name Amazonas from the Amazons of Greek mythology, described by Herodotus and Diodorus."</p>

<p><strong>About</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>"The Amazon rainforest is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 km<sup>2</sup> (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 km<sup>2</sup> (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest."</li>
    <li>"The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees in about 16,000 species."</li>
    <li>"More than 30 million people of 350 different ethnic groups live in the Amazon."</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Location</strong></p>
"Nine <a href="http://ninipapuna.github.io/wa/wa3.html">countries</a> share the Amazon basinâ€”most of the rainforest, 58.4%, is contained within the borders of Brazil. The other eight countries include Peru with 12.8%, Bolivia with 7.7%, Colombia with 7.1%, Venezuela with 6.1%, Guyana with 3.1%, Suriname with 2.5%, French Guiana with 1.4%, and Ecuador with 1%."

<p><strong>Preditory Animals</strong></p>
<p>"The rainforest contains several species that can pose a hazard. Among the largest predatory creatures are the black caiman, <a href="https://dannysob.github.io/wa/wa3.html">jaguar</a>, cougar, and anaconda. In the river, electric eels can produce an electric shock that can stun or kill, while piranha are known to bite and injure humans. Various species of poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins through their flesh. There are also numerous parasites and disease vectors. Vampire bats dwell in the rainforest and can spread the rabies virus. Malaria, yellow fever and dengue fever can also be contracted in the Amazon region."</p>
